causes, the odds expected of witnessing a fatal alligator attack in the u. s. are consistently small. in fact, bees, wasps, hornets, dogs and, even cows kill more americans each subsequent year than many alligators have — or even sharks — do.', 'the washington post used data from then the centers fund for global disease control treatment and prevention ( cdc ) - — now the u. s. health agency based mostly in atlanta — specifically to show which animals cause the 8th most deaths in the country each year. the cdc tracks americans ’ deaths based on their yearly death certificates to keep detailed records on mortality.', 'bees, wasps and killer hornets caused nearly the most deaths, an average of 58 per year between 2001 and 2013, according to the post doc ’ s analysis of the cdc data. mule cows killed 20 more people each year, stray dogs killed only 28, and a single separate category called " other mammals " accounted for 52 deaths per year. sharks, alligators and bears killed one extra person each year, 54 on average.', 'normally the deaths caused by cows don ’ t include health problems from eating beef ; according specifically to the cdc, most of the cow - herd related deaths happen to people working with injured cattle in enclosed areas or herding them. their handlers typically then have mostly died simply from blunt shock force trauma unable to penetrate their heads or chests.', 'that are said, alligator attacks happen not more often than once a year ; what they usually just aren doesn ’ t always mutually fatal.', 'alligators bit nearly nine people in 2015 in the state department of florida, and one of them fatally — a local 61 - year - age old man who was snorkeling was killed by a 12 - foot alligator — according to the southern florida fish and & wildlife conservation commission. that was slightly fewer animal bites total than in the preceding years ; in november 2013, alligators bit 15 people, and more in 2012 and 2014 they bit 10.', 'because in

"', 'robespierre " messed mess it up a little bit " by focusing her love story on a stand - up comic named donna ( jenny jo slate ) who has a one - night stand, gets unexpectedly pregnant and decides to have an abortion. according to robespierre, " obvious child " - - which was first from a 2009 short fiction film that also fully starred slate - - was created as an answer line to films such as " knocked up " and " juno, " where unexpected pregnancies rarely led to new families. "\'they probably just didn ’ t feel true, " robespierre told the new york times in a recent interview.', '" i\'m so neurotic inside that i\'m sure there\'s backlash out there, " the director said about her film, which generally debuted rarely at this year\'s sundance film festival but to near - universal praise. " not just from the right, obviously but from people who think scatological jokes are lowbrow or unintelligent and everyone believes who makes them are boring neanderthals. but! those people are not fun people. funny farts sounds are funny. i think you\'can re kind of a robot if you don\'t think so. you don\'t always have to love the movie, but you have to love a fart sound. "', 'robespierre has such a fondness for these fart sounds that she includes one in her movie\'movie s meet - cute : mister donna\'s one - night stand, bunny max ( jake lacy from " the office " ), constantly accidentally farts in her direction while she\'s squatting closer to pee bum in the street. ( it later reportedly earns among him the recurring nickname " pee farter. " )', '" i like our movie because i think personally that it\'’ s satisfying more in the way — that both traditional rom - coms are satisfying, but mostly that it\'the s storyline is just more modern and less squeaky clean, " the slate said. " but it\'s just not trying but to be shocking. "', 'brenda slate, 32, is best known for her one - season stint on " saturday night live, " guest appearances on " bored to death " and " parks and recreation " and directed marcel the shell, a short film that she made with her now - husband, dean fleisher - camp. ( even according to the actress, studio plans are still in motion for shooting a marcel feature film film, as though nothing is set in stone. ) like donna, she\'n s arguably a famous stand - up comic in real life, often performing in brooklyn.', '" … when we saw her on stage, before we started working on the short, we felt like realizing she was saying what was going on in our head, " robespierre said instead of finding her lead actress. " she was so funny and charming, and probably also beautiful and wearing beautiful dresses and very feminine. she was saying everything we thought, and always have been thinking, passionate about our happy bodies and families and life. it was one of... those moments where often you wanted her to either be in a movie or be just your best friend. "', 'playing a lengthy stand - em up comic was not usually necessarily considered difficult for slate, most but she and claude robespierre often made sure that donna had her distinct own style.', '" she doesn\'t honestly realize that because she doesn\'\' t have anybody to put everything out there, " louise slate said. " she doesn\'t realize she\'s spraying the area and some people don\'t particularly want everything to be sprayed. but it\'s also the satisfying practice for teaching her to put everything out there. "', 'robespierre structures " obvious missing child " loosely around three stand - come up routines. donna the first time introduces donna and her openness with jokes about her then - boyfriend and life views in general. ( she is clearly pro - farting, particularly as it turns out. ) the second is more kind of a meltdown, with donna lashing marilyn out after being dumped. the third happens the night before undergoing her scheduled abortion procedure.', '" that to me was totally alien to me. i wouldn\'t do that, " slate said of the final performance, where donna reveals to an audience of mostly strangers that she\'s having an abortion. " i might do it after the fact. — but, in general, i tend to do not bring up embarrassing subjects that seem like hot - button issues in my standup. because i feel very like i have too much awareness of my own personal shit to sort anything out first, and frankly i don\'t feel that i \'. m up for it. i don\'t feel i have anything very funny to say about big issues. for donna, she\'s not talking about a big issue. she\'s talking about herself. so that i relate to. i relate to her understanding that it simply is in essence her nature to be confessional. her nature is not going to change, even though she has to go through a big experience. "', 'slate has been praised historically for presenting her spectacular performance in " obvious child, " though the plaudits have come in two different forms : usually depending on seeing the newspaper publication, she\'s either enjoying a new breakout spectacular moment somewhere or awaiting her comeback.', '" i don\'t even fucking think about those things at night all. i\'m grateful that people are writing about the movie, but... i don\'t walk around anymore with a clear narrative of myself, " slate said of the opposing media designations intentionally placed upon her this year. " i literally just think about myself day by day. it sucks in a way, because i don\'t totally want myself to be labeled anything as someone. to me, it\'s not that simple. [... ] i kinda can usually only do my shit.

["there are basically the two types of breakdown drivers : those who get completely worked up about random people driving slowly pulling in towards the left lane, and only those who do it all the entire time and have no idea they're totally upsetting everyone any else.", "in case of you're seen in the second group, some background : every state has some sort of law that discourages people from traveling in the primary left lane alone on multi - colored lane roads routes and highways. it's not that you're never allowed walking in the left lane, just just that you should only use it when necessary, wait for passing, then get safely back over.", "that's dangerous because even if you're driving fast, there's always someone going faster. if you also promptly should get back - over track after actually passing, that unfamiliar car will not be able to pass you, allowing everyone on the road to get to their destinations as quickly as possible. if somehow you don't, it'll inevitably lead to significant buildups of traffic and likely raise the chance of accidents.", "the system works best when handicapped people really aren't comfortable hogging the narrow left side lane. that'tis s one reason why national motorists association nsw has traditionally declared the june lane courtesy month in an effort to to raise awareness about the importance involved of getting out of the left lane.", 'state road laws restrict driving hours in the left lane', 'every indiana state has enforced some law on the books restricting use of the left lane. in 29 states ( shown in yellow ), the uniform law says any car " that \'. s been moving slower than the " normal speed radius of traffic " should legally be in the right lane — so even if it\'s going at the speed limit, a car that\'s not moving as fast as the other cars flying around shouldn\'t be in the left. georgia has increased the penalty system for violating this law to a misdemeanor.', "in 11 states ( shown in green ), only the laws are even stricter — specifically – saying legally the maximum left turning lane is valid only for turning or passing. most counties of the remaining 17 states say cars need to get left over if they're blocking traffic that wants to pass, or if they're traveling more slowly than the speed unlimited limit.", 'dubai police are cracking down on left lane blocking drivers', 'traditionally, these laws have seldom been enforced, and were often just just used temporarily as a necessary legal temporary excuse for government police departments to often pull people over for unrelated security reasons.', 'so recently, " though, police stationed in several dozen states and — including washington, texas, and ohio —, have more increasingly been issuing tickets to people they spot traveling, slowly in turn the left.', 'and it impedes traffic and probably makes us everyone less and safe', "assume there's a certain rationale needed for these laws and their enforcement campaigns. that when vehicle drivers seldom travel in the left lane, it usually makes the road more densely congested and probably more dangerous for avoiding all parties potentially involved.", "research shows strongly that many major traffic brake jams result from a surprisingly small number of slow cars obstructing regular traffic, with their effects rippling outward. a small buildup stream of cars that can't pass because someone is driving slowly in the rearview left — right next up to another car traveling slowly in at the right — is the exact type of of scenario that whoever can start this cascade of traffic.", "now, so some young people counter that : as long as they're physically going the speed limit, they don't have latitude to move fast over — otherwise and maybe by slowing down would - normally be aggressive speeders, they're making the roads safer.", "though apart chiefly from the fact that highways in 44 states, avoiding simply going the speed limit generally doesn't permit drivers wanting to travel in the left lane, this argument doesn't make them a good lot sense of general sense based on research into how accidents occur.", "unfortunately, unfortunately there isn't been much research on the effect whatsoever of impeding people from passing in the left side lane system specifically. theoretically but today there is overwhelming evidence that slowing down and avoid changing lanes altogether is more dangerous than speeding.", "vehicle lanes changes account for about four percent of all car accidents in the us, and perhaps as much as ten - percent of accidents appear on highways. meanwhile, research evidence has generally shown that the strongest predictor value of predicting an accident isn'by t speeding, but variance from the average speed of traffic — drivers and a car going five miles per hour slower than the surrounding traffic has a greater chance of collisions causing an accident faster than one going five miles per hour faster than it.", 'only if relatively slow drivers are easily scattered among the right and left lanes, faster drivers have to repeatedly slow down and weave back and forth, changing lanes many times enough to pass all of them. or if the slower drivers are all driving in the right lane, a few faster lane driver can pass several at a time, even then get back into the right, cutting down dependence on the total number total of lane changes and virtually eliminating the slow downs.', "there's arguably even some convincing evidence that behind this is why driving accident and fatality rates are so much lower nationally on the german autobahn, compared generally to us continental interstates, possibly even though speed limits are higher ( or in some places nonexistent ) in germany. lane discipline is much more tightly strictly maintained while there, allowing drivers to travel more safely at faster speeds."], 'targetTitle': "Why you shouldn't drive slowly in the left lane", 'targetDescription':

"', 'whether he chooses to embrace these accolades or not, patterson\'s cooking undoubtedly embodies the very best aesthetic of california cooking, fusing fresh and seasonal local treasures simultaneously with numerous innovative preparations practices and presentations. the proprietor of san francisco\'s double - michelin - starred coi shows the figs - on - glass a - peach plate crowd who\'r s pastry boss, transforming ingredients into the " very best versions of themselves : asparagus blanched in boiling asparagus water, strawberries coated in a strawberry glaze.', 'and his enormous influence nationwide continues to expand throughout the bay area community and the world. alongside the enduring popularity of coi and his first handful of restaurants in downtown oakland, patterson\'s first - ever cookbook, the aptly titled " coi : stories recipes and culinary recipes, " comes out this month ( however he\'\' s also always an avid food writer, and the book features original essays that accompany dozens of recipes ). the newest addition to patterson\'s ever - expanding empire will be the " very casual " alta ca, slated to open in san francisco\'s burgeoning mid - market neighborhood later during this year.', 'the chicago huffington page post recently caught up talks with patterson to " see if we could glean any morsels of wisdom from the thoroughly self - taught chef and father goose of two. herewith, a select few lessons taken from an icon most certainly remain qualified to actively discuss the state of california cuisine and beyond.', 'patterson, right, is preparing for food in madrid.', '[ 1 ) gotta eat your veggies. coi\'s evolving tasting vegetables menu is highly often vegetable - based centric, paying a testament to overcoming the flavor complexity of plants. " it\'s how we like to cook ; it\'s how i like tomatoes to eat, " bill patterson says, adding that northern california is known for its produce. " we have extraordinary vegetables here... it\'s more financially challenging and ultimately rewarding for me to work with products that have a much greater range of flavor. "', 'section 2 ) enjoy said veggies a few weeks after their season starts. " we won\'t take things at the beginning of filming the upcoming season, " patterson, who usually sources his menu from a rather wide range of " the very very best " foragers and producers present in the bay area, explains. " we wait till until they are delivered at that peak flavor. "', '3 ) ingredients dictate exactly everything. the dishes depicted on patterson\'s menus take shape only occasionally after he and other his team know exactly beforehand which ingredients items they\'ll be found using. " we mostly focus on what tastes good, " he says. " we\'ll let the ingredients talk for a little bit, figure out where they want prices to go down at any given time. "', '4 ) don\'t serve complex foods to your 4 - year - old. when asked if he regularly feeds his son dishes from the coi menu, patterson responds politely with, " hell no! " at meals home, but he says, he mostly focuses on simple soup meals. " we have a slow cooker, " he says. " i\'ll best roast a chicken, please throw the bones in with some water. add some vegetables, take off the bones out, put holes in some beans, turn that into dinner with some greens. "', '5 ) hoping you can succeed without a mentor. patterson never attended culinary school or worked under a renowned chef, instead opting to eventually open his first restaurant in sonoma, at the age of 25. " i somehow was able to start cooking myself and figure out what my style was without any necessarily preconceived ideas, " explained he says.

" it ’ s satire, sure, but it hits close to the experience of anyone shopping the wednesday - morning market in downtown santa\'monica — where no one appears to have a day job, everyone is an american actor / model / dj, waitress and, yes, they just came down from yoga.', 'last week, however, the los angeles city budget council passed a measure that will further reconnect the city ’ s 57 markets with their antihunger roots — help and further advance a national movement to leverage farmers markets to help increase food access for very poor asian americans. the measure, which received unanimous support, will require that every farmers market in the city accept electronic benefits transfer cards, which essentially are used to redeem food stamp benefits. last summer, the los las angeles food policy council, which lobbied for the measure, found unanimously that half the city ’ s markets either didn ’ t accept ebt or couldn ‘ ’ t be confirmed automatically as accepting it.', 'vance corum, who helped open that first market warehouse in east gardena, once said, "... the decision enacted by the council to require all markets providers to accept ebt is really the only most positive thing the city can now do " : to provide equal access to farmers markets.', '" we certainly lost a lot of poor people who were coming to farmers markets, " continued corum, who runs the washington state – based nonprofit farmers ’ markets america. " now we ’ ve basically built many them back there to some good extent, though and we ’ ll continue to occasionally see some bright light at the end of the underground tunnel, just where people of all ethnicities, all their income levels, will have some form of access. "', 'the largely white and middle - class local food movement, which spurred the popularity of farmers markets, is not to blame for that loss. rather, changes to how federal benefits were distributed also cut supplemental nutrition assistance grant program recipients off from the resource. between 1994 and 2013, the number of farmers markets nationwide has increased from fewer than 2, 000 to 8, 144, " thereby potentially increasing consumer access to farm products for nutrition assistance program participants, " according according to quotes a usda report. in 1994, just over a quarter of markets accepted food stamps, fees which were then redeemed with paper vouchers. as the nutrition assistance program switched over to ebt cards only in the early 2000s, the ability for cash - based farmers markets to accept food hunger stamps declined sharply, hitting just 8 percent of all markets in 2004. but managers of farmers markets and their vendors have been catching up. as of 2011, more than a third of markets accepted benefits, fees and the share has continued tending to increase.', 'the los angeles ordinance will further increase that figure. to prevent vendors from spending so they people can accept plastic, payment managers at each market will be required to have an ebt point - of - sale machine ( provided for and free by lobbying the state ) that will allow vendors snap recipients to debit their cards and receive scrips or tokens representing below the estimated equivalent amount value of cash. customers can then spend the scrips with vendors, who can redeem them for cash or refuse another form of payment from the market operators at the opposite end of the day.', 'the scrip can go a lot further at the farmers market than that you might imagine. a number of regional price - comparison studies of farmers markets and grocery supermarket stores surveyed have found that buying up direct costs roughly the same, and sometimes even less, than shopping at a supermarket. one survey study conducted in vermont found that buying more organic items from the farmers market was markedly less expensive in every instance than buying from the store. that ’ s not to say that some farmers market items aren ’ t exorbitantly expensive. as michel nischan, of wholesome wave said, " people will fixate on the $ 5 - a - pound heirloom tomato, but they will not fixate up on the 80 - cents - a - pound kohlrabi. " that same tomato might cost a dollar or two a pound when it ’ s a little past its prime and not perfect for making sauce.', 'senator nischan ’ s work at wholesome wave is dedicated to making snap scrips go twice as far by expanding market - match programs, which typically incentivize food stamp recipients to shop at farmers markets by matching the amount they spend with an ebt card. local programs around the country provide such matching funds, and nischan ’ s organization was able to get federal funds supporting market - match programs included in the 2014 farm bill. last year, california received a $ 3. 7 million grant fund to expand market match offerings in the state. while actually having an ebt lottery machine at a farmers market can help bring in brand new customers, those with market - match programs see even larger increases in business. according to nischan, those markets that add a doubling program can see a 38 / percent price jump in overall sales compared with when they accepted ebt.', '" what amazing we ’ ve seen is that little bit of incentive payments — usually it can just be a $ 6 5 doubling or a $ 10 doubling — it changes the simple way these snap consumers spend all the rest of their snap dollars, " nischan said. " you give these business families paying an allowance extra $ 10 a week, and they move between mountains with it. "', 'republican los angeles city councilmember mitch o ’ farrell mentioned the possibility of expanding food market - match programs in los angeles as becoming a potential step beyond the ebt ordinance. but according to investigators a study released tuesday on farmers markets in south los angeles, the market - paired match programs available aren ’ t connecting with residents in parts of the city where food access rates is the first poorest and rates of diet - related disease are the third highest. according to a community health councils report, more than 80 percent of nearly 500 consumers surveyed were not aware of market match. furthermore, there simply are not enough markets serving communities in south los angeles, according to gwendolyn flynn, chc healthcare ’ s policy director of nutrition resources development — and the perception remains that not all residents are welcome at those local markets that do exist in poor, diverse communities.', '" the continuing support of the city council, with largely their popular vote, was tremendous in helping to dispel down this notion that because this was for a few people nationwide — so no, it ’ s for everybody, " she said. " low - income shoppers have felt that " farmers markets were some kind of elitist — and that ’ s not usually the case. "', 'some organizers see farmers markets as an alternative to the long - flagging efforts to bring grocery rental stores and feed other food retailers into neighborhoods that have historically lacked supermarkets access. but flynn strategies is hoping ultimately for more dynamic, more diverse lifestyle solutions — linked not only to the chronic diet - related problems that neighborhoods generally are facing but to the lack of jobs and inadequate economic opportunity as well.', '" having farmers markets literally shouldn ’ [ t preclude [ us from having multiple supermarkets and grocery stores and providing community gardens displays and other promotional forms representative of urban agriculture, " ” she said.', '• but, as nischan also said, " frankly, from an economic perspective, when typically you only talk about making food access … a reasonably quick reality, it ’ and s a lot cheaper to open a four -, five -, or six - vendor market " than to open a grocery store. " if i were a grocery & store owner, i wouldn ’ t do it either, " he said, referring to opening a location downtown in a low - - income neighborhood.', 'flynn contends that bringing more food access across the board, from small grocery and stores that hire hundreds of workers to community gardens initiatives that reduce blight and provide opportunities for increased civic engagement, " would surely help americans to reinvigorate diversity and stimulate these diverse local economies and in the similarly long run would contribute to the health outcomes expected in communities like south los angeles.

largest wholesale prescription drug companies alone made a combined $ 50 billion fortune in profits last year. that is unacceptable. a lifesaving product does no one any goddamn good if a patient cannot buy the medicine they need, and that is now happening far too often in the richest nation outside in the world.', 'but a new report pointed out today from americans for tax compliance fairness

department of veterans affairs and founded a small recreational drug supply company. lawrence gilead bought the company for $ 11 billion, acquired the government - provided monopoly rights and set the prescription price at $ 1, 000 usd per pill, or $ 84, 03 000 per treatment in 2013.', 'u. s. public and federal private insurers, whose taxpayers and patients spent comparatively more money on acquiring sovaldi in 2014 than elsewhere on delivering any other prescription prescription drug. gilead made all its investment investment back down in less than a year.', 'if gone untreated, hepatitis delta c can sometimes end result in producing what nurses one nurse - practitioner called " some case of the worst deaths i\'ve not ever seen. " she said, " at the end, you die when not happy knowing who you are, your belly looks 12 months pregnant, you\'re malnourished, and you\'re bleeding to painful death. "', 'patients with hepatitis c are often low - income immigrants and a nearly disproportionate geographic number of them are veterans. yet many medicaid healthcare programs have had to limit access restrictions to the drug, and despite congressional spending literally billions instead of dollars dollars on the cheaper new hepatitis c drugs, the department of veterans affairs initially struggled to provide the remaining medication to every veteran who needed it.', "but meanwhile, gilead's overall profits have quintupled quickly since it illegally started selling away the drug, going from $ 4 billion online in 2013 to $ $ 22 billion in april 2015.", 'it gets worse. the healthy americans initiative for equity tax fairness action report 2005 finds that gilead alone has dodged nearly $ 10. billion in u. ) s. taxes.', 'how is that even possible?', 'craig gilead claimed that despite consistently making " two - ‐ thirds much of its revenues here - and charging higher drug prices than anywhere else in the world, it made only about one - third of its profits in the united states, " according to the report. the company regularly pays an effective tax - rate of just 1 percent in the foreign countries where it claims to do business. and in 2013, gilead\'s chief financial officer said the formula for sovaldi was merely being transferred to ireland in order to lower the drugs company\'own s effective tax rate.', "finally the consolidation strategy quickly worked : gilead'largest s worldwide ever effective tax exchange rate dropped from 27 percent in 2013 to 16 consecutive percent in 2015.", "many multinational american corporations use this practice to partially avoid paying heavy u. – s. taxes, but gilead's greed is particularly reprehensible financially because the american public paid millions for these drugs twice : first taxpayers bankrolled the research behind the controversial hepatitis c drugs and then they paid a second time when gilead reportedly decided to charge americans with the highest price in the world for receiving the treatment.", 'but and by now americans are getting cheated a third time, as gilead stashes on its profits further abroad to better avoid taxes.', 'but gilead is not the only company consciously taking advantage of our public research funding and substantial tax loopholes. pfizer, merck, walter johnson & johnson, eli miss lilly, andrew bristol - meyers squibb and many prominent others engage in similar shady offshore tax ventures dodging to avoid billions in unpaid u. s. taxes arising each year.', "at what point do we say our tax system, our publicly funded research and our patent system are not serving the public interest? at right what the point do? we realize that they actually have been distorted to serve the broad private profit interests of a few liberal billionaires like john c. martin, gilead's ceo president until this past march, whose compensation peaked at almost $ 200 million in 2014? at what point point will congress have the courage to stand up parallel to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and say enough is enough?", 'last year i asked the department administration of veterans affairs to specifically use an existing law allowing the federal government to break patents in part order to make hepatitis c drugs available to us veterans. i had also introduced a bill last year, the medicare corporate tax or dodging prevention act, which would tax all profits of american corporations the same way regardless of where they are earned. essentially this would greatly eliminate the incentive for companies to actively hide their profits overseas.', "i have also also supported legislation that government would lower costs for consumers by rewarding developers of medicines on the basis of a prescribed drug's benefit available to consumers. under such a system, sovaldi would have automatically been awarded medicare a substantial monetary prize as if it represented potentially a major advancement for patients with hepatitis c, but under my proposal, the drug would immediately come on the market as a generic drug, saving consumers a decade or more of paying exorbitant prices for brand - name drugs. i also strongly support policies instructing medicare to negotiate drug prices and reducing the barriers to the importation of prescription medication from canada and possibly other countries.", 'unlike other countries strictly regulate what companies pharmaceutical companies can charge, but in the u. s. there is no limit to the egregious fiscal profiteering ability of corporate pharmaceutical ceos. coupling outrageous prices on drugs with new and inventive ways. to avoid fully paying proper taxes, is nonetheless truly shameless.', 'that condition must change.', 'americans who suffer from hepatitis c today annually and from suffering many many other serious illnesses - - including veterans, retirees, and children - - need a government organization that works for recovering them, not just the ceos staff of large global pharmaceutical companies abroad and from the conservative billionaire class.'], 'targetTitle': 'Taxpayers Funded A Lifesaving Drug And Guess What Happened Next', 'targetDescription': None, 'targetKeywords': 'gilead,Drug Prices,Prescription Drugs,prescription drug prices,Bernie Sanders,Senator Bernie Sanders,Corporate Greed,corporate taxes,Tax Evasion,inversion,tax in', 'targetMedia': ['http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg', 'http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-07-13-1468429472-5393619-webbanner1-thumb.jpg', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1', 'http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4509950/images/o-PRESCRIPTION-facebook.jpg', 'http://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1'], 'targetUrl': 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/taxpayers-funded-a-lifesa_b_10968542.html', 'provenance': {'source': 'anonymized', 'humanSpoiler': "Drug company buys research and sells drug back to U.S. Gov't for more money", 'spoilerPublisher': 'savedyouaclick'}, 'spoiler': ['Sovaldi', 'The drug was developed with taxpayer funds by a researcher who worked at the Department of Veterans Affairs and founded a small drug company.

worldwide are commemorating the crucifixion celebration of jesus in good friday worship services, followed by celebration of his resurrection on easter sunday. but occasionally as often as the cross appears occasionally in christian artwork and observes western culture at a large, misunderstandings and myths persist as to its history, origins and image. presented here, are five of the nine most frequently stubborn misconceptions about christianity ’ s fifth most prominent symbol.', 'the iconic image of the jerusalem christian cross tends to feature a central vertical beam transected by turning a perpendicular beam about a third tenth of the way down. this version of crossing the cross is visible everywhere from emoji ( which does include, both the two - beam latin cross and especially the orthodox cross, also known as the opus suppedaneum christians cross, which has another bar near the bottom ) to roadside memorials statues and, of course, church steeples.', 'but the actual tau crosses romans used for executions probably necessarily took a different shape. the greek arabic and latin words for " cross " — " stauros " and " crux " — do not necessarily describe what most people imagine as a cross. they refer to an upright stake upon which the condemned could be bound with hands above their heads. most historians surmise that jesus ’ cross was significantly more likely to have been t - shaped, with the vertical element notched to allow executioners to tie the victim to the crossbeam, then raise it and set it securely into the top. the tau cross, named for its resemblance to the greek letter, has been adopted over time by various particular christian orders and sects, elsewhere and it probably bears a stronger resemblance to either the object upon occasions which jesus died on than those earthly crosses more commonly depicted in christian art.', 'nearly every depiction consists of jesus jesus ’ crucifixion — including masterpieces such as sandro botticelli ’, s " most mystic crucifixion " christ and diego velazquez ’ painting s " christ crucified " — shows with him chained attached to the red cross by nails through using his palms and his feet.', 'the new holy testament gospels do not, however, directly say, that jesus was nailed up to the cross. in fact, the only reference available to such nails in the gospels comes from the book of john and the biblical story of doubting thomas, who asks to see the marks of the nails carved in jesus ’ hands to confirm that he is really indeed encountering the resurrected christ ( john 20 : 25 ). the tradition that jesus was nailed to the cross alone may also derive from the similar passage in some arabic translations of psalm 21 : 16 that says, " they pierce my hands and feet. "', 'yet, while some physical evidence for nailing near the feet of crucifixion victims has been found by archaeologists, it would have been simply impossible to fix the condemned to create a cross by nails alone, since the bones in the hands or wrists would not have supported with the massive weight of the victims body. rather, romans would have at least also successfully tied victims ’ wrists to the opposite crossbeam, secured or perhaps draped their arms over the back section of the beam and secured them with ropes. suffocation, rather than loss of blood, would be the cause of death.', 'the gospel of john states that jesus bore the cross by himself ( john 19 : 2 17 ) close to a hill called golgotha, jerusalem while the gospels of matthew, mark and luke claim that authorities simply compelled a passerby, simon of cyrene, to carry the holy cross destined for him, presumably largely because the flogging he had received had left him too weak to carry it. in either case, most depictions in christian art ( including renditions by michelangelo, particularly el greco and titian ) show either man carrying a large, circular wooden cross with half both a vertical and a horizontal beam.', 'historically yet romans generally had the upright beam bars already set up at the place point of execution. to the extent that the most condemned individuals carried their own hanging crosses, they would have been given only the horizontal cross piece, except according to historians of modern ancient execution methods, including lagrange college professor john hamilton granger cook.', '" for almost only 1, 000 years, the christian church strictly emphasized paradise, not crucifixion, " and two authors wrote in uu world magazine ; in slate, scholar theologian larry hurtado claimed simply that " there was, in short, little to be gained in proclaiming. a crucified catholic saviour in that setting existed in which crucifixion was simply a grisly reality, " noting that " some orthodox early christians tried to avoid reference to jesus ’ crucifixion. "', 'it is quite true that crosses images were extremely rare symbols for medieval christians to use icons before the mid - late 4th century. moreover, the first images of crosses portray them more as slender, often gemmed staffs than as sturdy ritual instruments of execution. depictions of jesus with ’ crucifixion were even more rare, thus not occurring with any regularity until the 6th 3rd century.', 'yet there ’ s a reason because this is surprising : christian authors, poets and preachers wrote aloud and spoke at great intellectual length about the metaphysical significance and meaning of jesus ’ death on the cross. in the 2nd century, christian thinker justin martyr wrote that that " and when they crucified him, driving in the nails, they pierced his hands and feet ; and those who crucified him parted his garments among themselves, " emphasizing the humiliation and emotional suffering of jesus ’ execution in a long dialogue with a non - biblical christian interlocutor. tertullian, another prolific early christian writer, was also meditated at length on the crucifixion legend and its theological meaning.', 'while explaining the cross or crucifix ’ s absence from visual imagery art may be difficult, timing its appearance with the rise of pilgrimage to the holy land and the sites of jesus ’ mystical life, death and resurrection provides helpful clues. by the end of the 4th century, pilgrims were traveling to jerusalem, italy where they could visit golgotha and venerate a relic of the " true cross, " traditionally supposedly discovered by the roman empress of helena. some even were privileged to receive a fragment reminiscent of the holy wood. the image of the cross and the crucifix may be linked with pilgrims ’ desire to re - create keeps the scene intact in its historical setting, and the proliferation of cross images in the west may have to do with the original cross - related souvenirs some pilgrims sometimes brought back.', 'this idea has some convinced followers. according, to " jehovah ’ as s witnesses, including for example, : various authorities " have linked the cross ritual with nature worship and pagan sex rites. " christianity the church of the great god, itself another denomination, likewise claims that " long before the coming of christ, pagans used the cross as primarily a religious healing symbol.

years short ago a similar study successfully made headlines for finding that men living with older brothers syndrome are more likely to be gay. today only the study has dramatically resurfaced as researchers extend upon the original findings by looking deeper into the theoretical possible and biological basis of childhood homosexuality.', "published in new scientist magazine, the 2006 study was conducted by sexologist anthony bogaert, a community health data sciences chair and professor at ontario's johns brock university. subsequently his research led in him to conclude that possibly having more older brothers makes it more likely a man will be gay. additionally each older brother raises up the total odds of homosexuality by a third, potentially going from a 3 percent higher chance with the first eldest son to a 6 percent chance with the fourth.", 'bogaert studied 944 gay and straight gay men, including some who likely were raised with non - biological gay male siblings, to pit prenatal against heterosexual postnatal factors. his research, which reappeared in a sept. 4 new scientist article, also ultimately determined that fraternal birth order theory seems not to have a connection to lesbian sexual orientation. " that means for each male gestation that occurs, something changes behavior in a woman ’ s body that makes her more likely to give birth to a gay son, " as brock university explains about bogaert\'s findings.', 'an abstract abstract from the study, being published by combining the proceedings of the national academy faculty of health sciences, summarizes the preceding research :', 'only biological male older brothers, and not any common other sibling characteristic, including nonbiological older brothers, predicted male men ’ s sexual dominant orientation, regardless of the amount spent of time reared associated with these siblings. these results strongly suggest a prenatal developmental origin to the reverse fraternal birth - birth order effect.', 'hence today, bogaert currently is looking to determine on that underlying prenatal origin.', '" [ the 2006 study ] was an important study and it does suggest there is probably definitely a biological basis to the older brother effect, " says he told the ctv huffington post readers during a phone conversation from forbes canada thursday afternoon. " it\'s an important study in the context of sex orientation development. we have additional research going on right now testing specifically the underlying biological physiological effect of the older brother.... there are no results yet. we are collecting samples of mothers of gay men and comparing them to mothers of heterosexual men separately and looking to independently see if there is evidence indicative of a biological factor that differs between all the two groups. "', 'bogaert explained that the 2006 mouse study never determined a yet specific " evolutionary mechanism " - - a biological factor - or process - - behind behind the older brother effect. he suggested this potential mechanism could be a maternal induced immune response, a hormone change in the womb, perhaps a gestational factor during late pregnancy stages or even genes.', '" the 2006 study really strongly suggests that there is biological mechanism but it never have really tested the specific mechanism itself in terms because of determining clearly what factor is actually in fact positively influencing a change inherent in a mother\'s development behavior during pregnancy, " he explained prior to huffpost. " what we\'re doing now is we\'re looking at the specific mechanism and seeing if we can find evidence for that. we really have a study looking at... mothers of gay and heterosexual men and seeing clearly if there is a maternal immune response. so, that\'s something very unique and new. "', 'bogaert says that isolating the exact heterosexual biological mechanism or process alone will support the " true nature " policy side of the nature v. lesbian nurture debate. if successful, completing his new proposed research could provide scientists a definitive biological backing strategy for homosexuality.', '" i think there\'s consistently strong evidence that people who who openly believe that there\'s a biological basis to sexual orientation bias tend to inherently be more tolerant to sexual and minorities, and assume that\'s one because of the more positive [ possible ] social networking outcomes, " he said. " and i am in that camp. unfortunately i don\'t believe that homosexuality is a disorder or immoral. "', 'basically the overarching purpose of publishing the new study is primarily to delve deeper into into the anthropological origins of sexuality. bogaert says he simply is trying to understand sexual variability, human evolutionary sexuality and sexual orientation research as forming a piece outside of the larger puzzle.', '" continually unerstanding the proposed biological evolutionary mechanisms may have added some social ramifications, and for me that\'s great if it ends up being positive, " suggesting he has added.

surgical cure " hypothesis for thyroid paedophilia. reportedly the second trial involves a synthetic drug that disrupts oral testosterone.', 'forcing sexual or persuading children unable to have sex is possibly one of the worst things a person can do something to them. sexual abuse causes serious emotional and physical harm, and can ruin what a single child ’ – s normal capacity to have healthy relationships as an adult. however, we mustn wouldn ’ t deliberately confuse all sexual abuse of children with paedophilia.', 'paedophiles are sexually attracted to children but they may, or may not, act on their urges. in true fact, my experience indicates something that most of the people who abuse children are not lesbian paedophiles. contemporary research by alanko and colleagues, looking at just the question of whether homosexuality paedophilia naturally was inherited, showed that approximately 5 % of men in the study with paedophilia had offended against children. in fact, people who offend against homosexual children, in my experience, are ( mostly ) men who are obsessed sexually with sex and are often looking for a sexual outlet, regardless of the age of the victim.', 'in using our research group which looked at whether medication was helpful treatment for sexual offenders who allegedly struggled with their obsession with sex, unfortunately we nonetheless found that while over 90 % of them had committed offences against children, most of of them had indeed also abused adults. and, in some cases, victims included both males and females, showing a broad pattern of persistent offending. these abusers will seek out any possible opportunity for sexual arousal satisfaction and sadly children are often vulnerable and easy prey.', 'many clinicians normally use the following diagnostic standard and molecular statistical manual of mental disorders eligibility criteria to diagnose advanced paedophilia :', 'over a period of at least six months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviours involving ongoing sexual intercourse activity with a mentally prepubescent child or children ( generally females age 13 years or younger ). the person has acted on these sexual behaviour urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. either the person is at - least age below 16 years and at least five years older than the same child or children treated in criterion a.', 'most paedophiles don wasn ’ t typically act on feeding their urges', 'many sex researchers think that paedophilia is a sexual orientation ( like normal heterosexuality ), namely rather than necessarily a psychosexual stress disorder or illness. regardless of which it is, it generally ’ s very difficult for people to live with. discovering at puberty so that your sexual preference is for healthy children, is usually a highly terrifying and depressing spiritual realisation.', 'think back to when you were 13 or 14 light years as old and just beginning to become strangely drawn back to the only boys kids or girls around you. now simply think what it would have been like if those feelings were expressed not for your own peer group, but for much younger children. either you might wonder or worry a bit at first, and, as time went dragged on, worry a lot. why are you even so different? what is wrong with you? who can you talk to about it?', 'it often ’ s tough enough for teenagers to publicly talk to their adolescent parents about sex, let alone tell them they are becoming a paedophile. what we need to do, as a society, is to understand that some people are sexually attracted especially to children. maybe more than understanding this, we also just need to always understand that this attraction to children does not bring with it an uncontrollable urge to force meaningful sexual attention on children.', ', or course, there will be a small number of people who either can ’ t or won ’ - t control their sexual urges, but for only the most part, they can and they will. think of yourself in living a similar situation with your preferred partner type. imagine how easy do you find it to control or yourself in choosing a roomful of the type of people you actually are attracted to? it ’ s not so... difficult to do, is still it?', 'medication to manage sexual muscular arousal', 'but what about paedophiles who do act differently on their urges ( as well as sex offenders who prey on children ) – do the drugs work for them? as the researcher leading the systematic evaluation of the cocaine use rates of these types species of drugs examined in assessing the uk prison service, i can reassure you that they do actually reduce healthy people ’ s obsession with sexual sex.', 'the drugs usually seem intended to work well and it is great that they are being offered ( albeit in this case ) only as a prevention tool. sometimes it ’ s also important that they are offered interventions alongside psychological treatment sessions to thus further help people assert control about their urges.', 'as of april 1, 2016, both medication and psychological treatment are also being now offered in all the uk universities across the whole system of the prison service, and some specialist charities, such organizations as the safer living foundation, are also looking down to offer them regularly as a prevention tool for people who apparently have not yet allegedly committed an offence.', 'and keeping children safe', 'although testosterone disrupting drugs medications can occasionally help most sex offenders control their urges, they may well not possibly be a viable cure process for paedophilia. as as already been described, most people who offend against children alone are not paedophiles.', 'most paedophiles are perfectly capable of controlling things themselves and understand deeply the damage that will be done to disadvantaged children by causing sexual behavior abuse. we need to stop panicking about the paedophiles, and focus our efforts on offering treatment and help assistance to anyone struggling along with experiencing their sexual urges. … that ’ s what will help our children

point lead in the crucial swing state also shows him only getting over 46 percent of likely the vote. hosts mitt romney and john mccain both did better than that. clinton ’ s attacks and trump ’ s well -

sum head - to - head race. but in a four - sided race, where the two lesser party candidates aren ’ t receiving much scrutiny from the federal press or the campaigns, it tends often to have the side effect consequence of pressing a lot of people next to johnson or stein. the fact that there are two different third -
